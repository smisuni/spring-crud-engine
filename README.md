## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- **Git** (2.0+)
- **Docker** (20.10+)

## ðŸ–¥ Running the Application Locally

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/smisuni/spring-crud-engine.git
cd spring-crud-engine/
```

### Building the Docker Image
The Dockerfile is used to build the application image and run tests inside a container.
More details on running tests are provided in the section [Running Unit and Integration Tests](#-running-unit-and-integration-tests).

To build and test the full application, use:
```shell
docker build -t spring-crud-engine .
```
To skip tests during the build, use:
```shell
docker build --build-arg SKIP_TESTS=true -t spring-crud-engine .
```

### Running the Docker Container
**Option 1: Using `docker run`**

Run the container manually and expose port 8080:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /data:/app/data spring-crud-engine
```
**Option 2: Using `docker compose`**

Start the application via docker compose:
```shell
docker compose up
```
**Note**: 
- When running via Docker, the database is persisted in a mounted volume `/data` on host. This ensures that data is not lost when the container stops or restarts.
- For testing purposes, the application uses an in-memory H2 database, meaning no data is persisted between test runs.

### ðŸ§ª Running Unit and Integration Tests
A dedicated application profile named `test` has been created to run with an in-memory H2 database for fast and isolated testing.
To run tests inside a disposable container, without requiring Java or Maven installed locally, and **without building the full application jar**, run

```shell
docker build --target test -t spring-crud-engine:test .
```
The execution of tests generates coverage reports at `target/site/jacoco/index.html` inside the container.
To access the coverage report locally, either run `mvn clean verify -Ptest` outside Docker, or manually copy the `target/` folder from the container after building.

### Using the Prebuilt Docker Image
A prebuilt Docker image is available as an artifact in the GitHub Actions workflow.

To use the image:

1. **Download** the Docker image artifact:
   - Navigate to the **[Actions](https://github.com/smisuni/spring-crud-engine/actions)** tab of this repository.
   - Select the latest successful workflow run.
   - Download the `docker-image` artifact.
2. **Extract** the downloaded `docker-image.zip` data.
3. **Load** the extracted Docker image `spring-crud-engine.tar.gz` into local Docker.
    ```shell
    docker load < spring-crud-engine.tar.gz
    ```
4. **Run** the Docker container:
    ```shell
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data spring-crud-engine
    ```
The H2 database will be created inside the `data/` directory after the application starts.

## ðŸ—„ Database

- **Type**: H2 (File based, persistent)
- **Persistence**: Data is saved locally and remains even after the app stops and restarts.
- **Storage Location**: Database file is created at `./data/testdb.mv.db` inside the project folder.
- **In-memory Database for Testing**: An H2 in-memory database is used for unit and integration tests, automatically initialized and cleared after each run.
- **H2 Console**:
    - URL: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
    - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:file:./data/testdb`
    - Username: `username`
    - Password: `password`

These credentials can be modified inside `application.properties`.

## ðŸ“˜ API Documentation

Swagger UI is available at: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### ðŸ§ª Testing with Swagger

To test API endpoints:

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) in a browser.
2. Expand the desired endpoint.
3. Click "Try it out" to input parameters and execute requests.
4. View responses directly within the interface.

## âœ… CI/CD

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration and Docker for building and packaging the application. Every push or pull request to the main branch triggers the following:

- **Build** Docker images for testing and running the application
- **Run** unit and integration tests inside Docker
- **Extract and upload** JaCoCo code coverage reports
- **Upload** code coverage report to Codecov
- **Build** final Docker runtime image
- **Save and upload** the Docker image archive for deployments

See `.github/workflows/build.yml` for details.

## ðŸ“¦ Key Dependencies:
The following dependencies are used in this project:
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code.
- **Spring Boot Starter Web**: For building web applications with Spring Boot.
- **JaCoCo** : For code coverage.
- **Mapstruct**: For DTO entity mapping.
- **Swagger UI**: For generating interactive API documentation.
- **Jakarta Validation**: For input validation and enforcing constraints on Java objects.
